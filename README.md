Front-end development is in a stage of vigorous development. Now it can be said that most websites are focusing on the front-end. The front-end is the part that directly contacts users. It integrates design, programs, and some overall concepts, and some optimizations, including SEO. Many technologies are implemented through the front end, and how to do this part well is very challenging. Maybe four or five years ago, many people were still groping for the implementation of the standard, but now there is a general direction that everyone is moving towards the standard, so they can better persevere, focus better, and make the front-end technology stronger.
